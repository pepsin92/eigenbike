\section*{Methods}
Text for this section \ldots


\subsection*{Dataset}

For purposes of this project, we used web-scraped pictures from
several bicycle e-shops. We separated them into 3 classes:
Road, Mountain and City. In the end we ended up using only
Road and Mountain bikes due to low amount of City bikes in
training data.

Our dataset is composed of only a little over 200 images, making
training our models challenging. We split $10\%$ (25 images) for use
as validation dataset, which we kept constant for training of all
models.

We resized all immages to 64x64 pixels and converted them to monochrome. This has the effect of both making our models simpler and making color-based classification less likely to occur\footnote{As bike color trends can vary over time, we did not want our models to assume that, for example, mountain bikes tend to be yellow.}.

\subsection*{Convolutional neural network}

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are % TODO description

We implemented two different models for % TODO

In both models we use a kernel of size $(5, 5)$ for all layers when applicable. For activation function, we found that alternating ReLU and sigmoid provided best computational speed and accuracy. We experimented with different number of channels on each layer.

In the first model, we use only convolutional layers with a stride of (2, 2).

In the second model, we alternated typical convolutional layers with a stride of (1, 1) with MaxPool layers with a pool size of (2, 2).

In this section we examine the growth rate of the mean of $Z_0$, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$. In
addition, we examine a common modeling assumption and note the
importance of considering the tails of the extinction time $T_x$ in
studies of escape dynamics.
We will first consider the expected resistant population at $vT_x$ for
some $v>0$, (and temporarily assume $\alpha=0$)
%
\[
 E \bigl[Z_1(vT_x) \bigr]= E
\biggl[\mu T_x\int_0^{v\wedge
1}Z_0(uT_x)
\exp \bigl(\lambda_1T_x(v-u) \bigr)\,du \biggr].
\]
%
If we assume that sensitive cells follow a deterministic decay
$Z_0(t)=xe^{\lambda_0 t}$ and approximate their extinction time as
$T_x\approx-\frac{1}{\lambda_0}\log x$, then we can heuristically
estimate the expected value as
%
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqexpmuts}
E\bigl[Z_1(vT_x)\bigr] &=& \frac{\mu}{r}\log x
\int_0^{v\wedge1}x^{1-u}x^{({\lambda_1}/{r})(v-u)}\,du
\nonumber\\
&=& \frac{\mu}{r}x^{1-{\lambda_1}/{\lambda_0}v}\log x\int_0^{v\wedge
1}x^{-u(1+{\lambda_1}/{r})}\,du
\nonumber\\
&=& \frac{\mu}{\lambda_1-\lambda_0}x^{1+{\lambda_1}/{r}v} \biggl(1-\exp \biggl[-(v\wedge1) \biggl(1+
\frac{\lambda_1}{r}\biggr)\log x \biggr] \biggr).
\end{eqnarray}
%
Thus we observe that this expected value is finite for all $v>0$ (also see \cite{koon,khar,zvai,xjon,marg}).
